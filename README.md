# SOLID Principles in Java

This repository provides clean and understandable examples for each of the **SOLID principles** using Java. Each principle includes:

- A "Before" example (violating the principle)
- An "After" example (correctly applying the principle)
- Comments explaining why the code violates or adheres to the principle

## ðŸŒŸ SOLID Principles Overview

1. **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   _A class should have only one reason to change._

2. **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
   _Software should be open for extension but closed for modification._

3. **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
   _Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking functionality._

4. **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
   _Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use._

5. **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
   _High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions._
